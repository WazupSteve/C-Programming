enum: enumeration(to list) in c
1*) An enumeration is a user defined data type that consists of a set of named values 
    that represent integral constants, known as enumeration constants.

NOTE: It is used to replace #define chains
In short: a convienent name given to the integer constant--->enumerators using enumeration
2*) syntax:
enum <identifier>  //identifier name is optional
{
	enumerator1, enumerator 2,........,enumerator n
};

3*) In C, an enumeration constant is of type int. 

4*) If a constant expression is used as an initializer, 
    the value of the expression cannot exceed the range of int 
    (that is, INT_MIN to INT_MAX as defined in the header limits.h). 
    Otherwise, the condition is tolerated, a diagnostic message is issued, 
    but the value of the enumeration constant is undefined.

5*) If no explicit value is assigned to the first enumerator, then it takes the value 0

6*) Each enumeration constant must be unique within the scope 
    in which the enumeration is defined.
