Here is an example:

```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	#ifdef __MINGW32__
		printf("this code is running on Windows Machine\n");
		printf("enter two characters\n");
		char a,b;scanf("%c",&a);fflush(stdin);scanf("%c",&b);
		printf("entered characters are\n");
		printf("%c\t%c",a,b);
	#endif
	#ifdef __UNIX__
		printf("this code is running on UNIX Machine\n");
		printf("enter two characters\n");
		char a,b;scanf("%c",&a);fflush(stdin);scanf("%c",&b);
		printf("entered characters are\n");
		printf("%c\t%c",a,b);
	#endif
	return 0;
}
```

This C program is designed to demonstrate platform-specific compilation using conditional compilation directives. It includes two main conditional compilation branches: one for MinGW (Windows) and one for Unix-like systems.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Include the Standard Input-Output Library:**
    ```c
    #include<stdio.h>
    ```
    This line includes the standard input-output library, which is necessary for using functions like `printf` and `scanf`.

2. **Main Function:**
    ```c
    int main()
    {
    ```
    This is the entry point of the program.

3. **Conditional Compilation for MinGW (Windows):**
    ```c
    #ifdef __MINGW32__
    ```
    This directive checks if the `__MINGW32__` macro is defined, which indicates that the code is being compiled on a Windows machine using the MinGW compiler.

4. **Printing and Input on Windows:**
    ```c
    printf("this code is running on Windows Machine\n");
    printf("enter two characters\n");
    char a,b;scanf("%c",&a);fflush(stdin);scanf("%c",&b);
    printf("entered characters are\n");
    printf("%c\t%c",a,b);
    ```
    If the program is running on Windows, it:
    - Prints a message indicating the platform.
    - Prompts the user to enter two characters.
    - Reads the characters into variables `a` and `b`.
    - Flushes the input buffer with `fflush(stdin)` to handle any leftover input (though using `fflush(stdin)` is generally not recommended for input streams).
    - Prints the entered characters.

5. **Conditional Compilation for Unix-like Systems:**
    ```c
    #endif
    #ifdef __UNIX__
    ```
    This directive ends the previous conditional block and starts a new one, checking if the `__UNIX__` macro is defined, which indicates that the code is being compiled on a Unix-like system.

6. **Printing and Input on Unix:**
    ```c
    printf("this code is running on UNIX Machine\n");
    printf("enter two characters\n");
    char a,b;scanf("%c",&a);fflush(stdin);scanf("%c",&b);
    printf("entered characters are\n");
    printf("%c\t%c",a,b);
    ```
    If the program is running on a Unix-like system, it follows the same steps as for Windows, but with a different initial message indicating the platform.

7. **End of the Main Function:**
    ```c
    return 0;
    }
    ```
    The `main` function returns 0, indicating that the program has executed successfully.

### Summary

The program uses preprocessor directives to check the platform it is being compiled on (either Windows with MinGW or a Unix-like system). Depending on the platform, it executes the corresponding block of code to prompt the user for two characters and then prints those characters. The primary difference between the two blocks is the message indicating the platform.
